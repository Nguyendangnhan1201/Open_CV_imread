# Project: _Open_CV_imread_
## Overview:
A simple python program to read and show an image using Open CV.
## Set up:
1. I used Open CV combining with Python on Visual Studio code to read and show the image. You will need to download open cv using the terminal, once you have opened it, you should enter this command:  "pip install opencv-python" for the automatical download of the latest version.
2. A python file should be created and an image must be downloaded for the reading. I would recommend putting the code file and the image in the same folder.
## Some tips:
1. If you get an error with "pip", you may also try "pip3" instead.
2. You should also run the code directly on terminal to ensure the appearance of GUI display.
3. You should also check if you entered the right address of the image in the code.
